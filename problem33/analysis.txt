The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

SOLUTION:
Because both the numberator and denominator have two digits each, and only one is going to be cancelled out, then we have four possibilities
to consider

let a and b be the non cancelled digits, and c be the digit that will be cancelled out.
We are left with 4 equations.

PREREQUISITE:
1 <= a < b <= 9 and 1 <= c <= 9
This inequality limits the fraction to be less than 1 as per the instructions.

10c + a / 10c + b = a / b
10a + c / 10b + c = a / b
10a + c / 10c + b = a / b
10c + a / 10b + c = a / b

EQUATION 1:

10c + a / 10c + b =  a / b
10c + a = 10ac + ab / b
10bc + ab = 10ac + ab
b = a

This contradicts our original prerequisite and so is not a solution

EQUATION 2:

10a + c / 10b + c = a / b
10a + c = 10ab + ac / b
10ab + bc = 10ab + ac
bc = ac
b = a

This also contradicts our prerequisite and so is also not a solution

EQUATION 3:
